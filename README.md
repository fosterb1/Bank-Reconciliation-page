# **MaxReconcile - Bank & Ledger Reconciliation System**

## **Overview**
MaxReconcile is a web-based reconciliation system designed to automate the matching of transactions between bank statements and ledger records. It eliminates the need for time-consuming manual reconciliations by providing a fast and accurate reconciliation process through an intuitive interface.

## **Features**
- Upload bank and ledger CSV files for reconciliation.
- Automated comparison of transactions to identify matched and unmatched records.
- Real-time reconciliation reporting.
- Ability to download reconciliation reports in CSV format.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: None (uses in-memory processing for CSV files)
- **API Communication**: REST API for file uploads and report generation

## **Installation and Setup**
### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask (install using `pip install flask`)
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/maxreconcile.git
cd maxreconcile
```

### **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Run the Application**
```bash
python app.py
```
- The application will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## **How It Works**
1. **Uploading Files**  
   - Users upload bank and ledger CSV files through the web interface.
   - The system processes and compares the transactions.

2. **Reconciliation Process**  
   - Transactions are categorized as matched, unmatched, or pending.
   - The system highlights discrepancies for further review.

3. **Reporting & Exporting**  
   - Users can view reconciliation reports in a structured table.
   - Reports can be downloaded in CSV format for documentation.

## **Key Functionalities**
### **Frontend (User Interface)**
- Designed with a **responsive layout**.
- Uses JavaScript to handle **file uploads**, **fetch reports**, and **trigger downloads**.

### **Backend (Flask API)**
- Handles **file uploads** and stores them temporarily.
- Uses `reconciliation_logic.py` to **process CSV files** and **generate reports**.
- Provides **REST endpoints** to fetch reconciliation reports.

## **Usage**
1. **Navigate to the web interface** (`http://127.0.0.1:5000`).
2. **Upload your bank and ledger CSV files**.
3. **View the automatically generated reconciliation report**.
4. **Download the report in CSV format**.
